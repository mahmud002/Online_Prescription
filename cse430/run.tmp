State-vector 280 byte, depth reached 288, errors: 0
     2093 states, stored
      478 states, matched
     2571 transitions (= stored+matched)

hash conflicts:         1 (resolved)

Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
    0.599	equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
    0.483	actual memory usage for states (compression: 80.74%)
         	state-vector as stored = 222 byte + 20 byte overhead
  128.000	memory used for hash table (-w24)
    0.534	memory used for DFS stack (-m10000)
  128.925	total actual memory usage
